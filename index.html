  I am a software developer from Phoenix, Arizona. Since I can remember I have been a tech afficionado. Seeing the amazing new things that are released every year get me really excited! I have always wanted to be part of those changes. Developing websites, creating apps, being part of a team that affects people's experience in every single day use. I finally get to be part of this ever-changing culture that is software developer.

  About Me
  </h3>
      <p>
        For the greater part of my career, I was a sales person for AT&T. Within the course of 9 years I climbed the ranks from representative, to assistant, to store manager. I loved my work, I got to interact with many different personalities every day, never a dull moment. Taking advantage of benefits that AT&T provided to me, I took a few free courses in web devolpment.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Web development was new, exciting, challenging and something I grew passionate about really fast. Joining Thinkful was the best move I could've made. I am quickly acquiring the skills and knowledge that will prepare me for my new role as a software developer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am ready and excited to be an asset to a prestigious company, and to work together with a team of knowledgeable individuals, who like me, are looking to improve every single day. Please reach out to me if you have any questions, are looking to hire, or need a partner for any development projects.
